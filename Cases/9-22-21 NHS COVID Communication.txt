RE:                School Response to COVID-19 Cases - INFORMATION ONLY
Zero confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been identified at Northville High School.  We are working closely with the Wayne County Health Department and have identified possible exposures so as to prevent further cases.  This letter is informational only; no further action is required for your student or as a staff member at this time.


The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.  These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.  Spread is more likely when people are less than 6 feet from each other for 15 minutes or more within a 24 hour period.  A person who is a close contact of someone who is infected with COVID-19 may experience COVID-19 symptoms typically within 2 to 14 days after a person is exposed.


The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.  Symptoms can include:  Fever (>100.4oF), cough, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, runny or stuffy nose, loss of taste or smell, abdominal pain. 


At this time close contacts with exposures have been notified separately by Northville High School, in coordination with the local health department, and were required to self-quarantine.  


There are many things that can be done to keep our schools, homes, and communities “COVID-19 free” and protect ourselves and loved ones:


1. Children and adults should stay home when ill.
2. Washing hands often with soap and running warm water for at least 20 seconds. 
3. If a hand washing station is not available, use hand sanitizer properly.  Gels, rubs, and hand wipes must contain at least 60% alcohol.  Dispose of wipes in the trash after use.
4. Practice Good Respiratory Etiquette (cover a cough with elbow versus hand).
5. Follow guidance for wearing a face covering and social distancing. 


If you have questions or need further information about the spread of COVID-19, please contact the Wayne County Health Department Monday-Friday, during regular business hours at 734-727-7078.  The after hours and weekend call center number 734-727-7284.


We are grateful for our strong community partnership with our students, families, staff and our entire community to promote the safety, health and well-being of all.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
