SUBJECT:        School Response to COVID-19 Case(s) -- INFORMATION ONLY


One (1) confirmed case of coronavirus (COVID-19) has been identified at Northville High School.  This letter is informational only; no further action is required for your student or as a staff member at this time.


Our entire school community can continue to help mitigate COVID risk in our schools by:
* Keeping your child home if they are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 and use the COVID-19 Daily Student Symptom Screening Tool each and every day,
* Keeping your child home if they have been exposed to a positive case inside or outside the home,
* Testing for COVID if symptoms are present and staying home from school until you receive negative results,
* Getting vaccinated or the booster dose if eligible; talk to your doctor, or access vaccines through multiple sources, including CVS, and Meijer as well as several Wayne County Health Dept WALK-IN COVID VACCINE Clinics. 
If you have questions or need further information about the spread of COVID-19, please contact the Health Department Monday-Friday, during regular business hours at 734-727-7078.  The after hours and weekend call center number 734-727-7284.


We are grateful for our strong community partnership with our students, families, staff and our entire community to promote the safety, health and well-being of all.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
